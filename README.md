ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Utilities

A collection of lightweight Python scripts for basic DNA/RNA sequence analysis tasks. Built as part of personal exploration in computational genomics and bioinformatics.

ðŸš€ Features

ORF Detection â€” Identify and count open reading frames in nucleotide sequences.

Sequence Translation â€” Convert DNA/RNA sequences to protein sequences using Biopython.

Motif & Repeat Search â€” Determine most frequent nucleotide patterns.

Sequence Statistics â€” Find the longest and shortest sequences in FASTA files.

Counting Utilities â€” Count sequences and reads efficiently.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
